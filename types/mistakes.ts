// types/mistakes.ts
//
// "MY MISTAKES" — the student's own bucket of questions they got WRONG or LEFT
// BLANK, kept so they can come back and practise. Contract: docs/MISTAKES.md.
//
// ⚠️ A blank is NOT the same as a wrong answer and is stored as its own
// `outcome`. Both score zero, but "you skipped 6" and "you misunderstood 6" are
// different problems, and the bucket is a LEARNING surface — collapsing them
// would throw away the more actionable half.
//
// ⚠️ The question is SNAPSHOTTED here, not referenced. The same trade every
// exam-shaped collection in this repo makes: the paper a mistake came from can
// be edited, closed or deleted, and a mistake the student can no longer read is
// worthless. It also means the bucket renders from ONE query — no fan-out read
// per row.
