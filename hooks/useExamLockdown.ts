/**
 * Exam lockdown — full-screen, and a warning when the student leaves the paper.
 *
 * The behaviour was already implemented four separate times (`IeltsRunner`,
 * `WritingRunner`, `SpeakingRunner`, the class-test runner) with slightly
 * different rules each. This is the one implementation the **Rasch / Milliy
 * sertifikat** sittings use, living in a hook so the three pages that render
 * `ExamRunner` cannot drift apart. Contract: docs/STUDENT.md.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ What a browser can and cannot enforce
 *
 * A web page **cannot** stop a student opening another tab. `Ctrl`/`⌘`+`T`,
 * `Ctrl`+`N`, a second window, a phone's app switcher and a second device are all
 * outside any page's reach, and nothing here pretends otherwise. What this hook
 * actually does:
 *
 * | Escape route | What happens |
 * |---|---|
 * | Switching tab / minimising / app-switching | `visibilitychange` + `blur` → counted, and a **blocking overlay** the student must dismiss |
 * | Leaving full screen (`Esc`, F11) | counted the same way, with a button to go back in |
 * | Reload, close, typing a URL | `beforeunload` → the browser's own "leave site?" prompt |
 * | Right-click → "open in new tab" | context menu suppressed |
 * | The app's own nav | not reachable — the runner is a `fixed inset-0` overlay above the shell |
 *
 * So the honest description is **detect and deter**, not prevent. The count is the
 * deterrent: it is shown live while the paper is being sat.
 *
 * ⚠️ `requestFullscreen()` must be called from inside a **user gesture**, so it is
 * NOT called on mount — mounting happens in a re-render after the click, and
 * Safari and Firefox reject it there. `requestExamFullscreen()` is exported as a
 * plain function for the page's own Start handler to call, and the runner offers a
 * button to re-enter if the browser refused or the student left.
 */

/**
 * Ask for full screen. Call this **synchronously inside a click handler** (the
 * Start button), never from an effect. Safe to call when already full screen.
 *
 * Failure is silent and non-fatal on purpose: an iOS Safari that has no Fullscreen
 * API at all must still be able to sit the paper — the runner is a full-viewport
 * overlay either way, so losing the browser chrome is an enhancement, not a
 * requirement.
